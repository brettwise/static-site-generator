# Getting Started

## What to do when you've just freshly cloned this repo

From project root

'''
	cd src/sass 
	bower install
	cd ../../js
	bower install
	cd ../..
	npm install && gulp
'''

Probably go get coffee while npm does it's thing.


## On subsequent development

Assuming you shut down gulp and you're in project root...

'''
	gulp
